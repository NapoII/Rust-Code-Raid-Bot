# My Old Spaghetti Code 🛠️🍝

This folder contains some old, messy spaghetti code that I wrote when I was starting my programming journey. It's not pretty, it's not optimized, but it's a part of my learning experience and represents how far I've come. 

Sometimes it's fun to look back and see where I started, so I can't bring myself to delete it—kind of like an old memory picture! 📸

## Purpose
The code here serves no functional purpose today, but it's a nostalgic reminder of my early days as a programmer. You can explore it for fun or laugh at the chaos, but don't take it too seriously. 

## Notes
- **Do not delete**: This folder is a piece of history, and while it may not be useful anymore, it holds sentimental value.
- **No maintenance**: The code is as it was back then—untouched and unpolished.

## Enjoy! 😄
