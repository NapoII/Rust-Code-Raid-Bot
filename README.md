[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/ChatGPT_logo.svg" height="30px" />](https://github.com/NapoII/Rust-Code-Raid-Bot/raw/main/Rust-Code-Raid-Bot.rar) : The code was not written with ChatGPT. The code appears to be a Python script that uses the Brute-Force method to automate the process of entering codes (or "pins") into the game Rust in order to raid a base. The script is intended to be used on a specific target base, and requires the user to have a list of possible codes in a file located at a specific directory.
The script uses various Python modules such as keyboard, time, and pyautogui to simulate keystrokes, calculate statistics, and send chat messages within the game. Once activated by a specific hotkey, the script continuously checks if the Rust game window is open and attempts to retrieve the next code from the file. If successful, the script enters the code into the game and calculates various statistics such as the remaining number of codes, codes entered per minute, estimated time remaining to enter all codes, and percentage of codes completed. The script then formats a chat message containing this information and sends it in the game chat.

The purpose of this script is to automate a repetitive and time-consuming task in Rust, allowing the user to enter codes more efficiently and accurately in order to raid a target base. As this method involves trying every possible code combination, it is known as a Brute-Force method. It should be noted that using such methods in online games can be a violation of the game's terms of service and may result in consequences such as a ban or suspension of the user's account.
