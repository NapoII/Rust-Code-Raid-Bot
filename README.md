This application requires Python 3.10.7.
```
git clone https://github.com/NapoII/Rust-Code-Raid-Bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyhton Rust-Code-Raid-Bot.py
```

## Introduction 🚀

This Python script is designed to assist Rust players in opening code-locked doors. It generates a random 4-digit code based on IT security research's top sequence of codes when the player presses the hotkey "Alt + E." Please note that this script does not automatically open doors but simplifies the process of determining the correct code.

## Usage 📋

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Run the script in the background while playing Rust.

3. In Rust, open a Codelocker you wish to open.

4. Press the hotkey "Alt + E." 🕹️

5. The script will calculate and input the next suitable code based on research data.


## Statistics 📊

The script provides real-time statistics in the team chat to keep you informed about your progress:

- Current Code: >>1234<<
- Number of Attempts: [0/9999]Pins
- Pins per Minute: [6.037]Pin/min
- Estimated Time to 100%: [27.6] hours ⏳
- Progress: [0.01/100]%

## Important Notes 🚨

- This script does not guarantee success in opening code-locked doors, as it relies on random code generation based on research data.

- Be cautious not to use this script for cheating or exploiting the game's mechanics, as it may violate Rust's terms of service and result in consequences. 🚫

- Use this script responsibly and enjoy playing Rust with added convenience. 😊
